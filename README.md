# Java Mini Game

A small Java-based game I built for fun and experimentation while learning programming fundamentals. This project was created as a personal/academic exercise rather than a full-scale software application.

## About the Project
- Simple game logic implemented in Java
- Focused on experimenting with control flow, user interaction, and basic game mechanics
- Built as a creative side project alongside coursework

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Basic object-oriented programming
- Eclipse IDE

## Why This Project Exists
This project is included on my GitHub as a **learning and creativity showcase**, demonstrating early experimentation with Java and problem-solving through game development.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in a Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse)
2. Run the main game file
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play

## Notes
This project is intentionally lightweight and was created for enjoyment and learning rather than production use.
